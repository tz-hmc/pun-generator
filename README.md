## Why?
why not

## What is this
- Something something haha "oh-pun source"
- Cracked up
- Suddenly decided to write a pun generator
- Is much harder than I imagined
- Waiting 10 minutes for pun to be returned much less satisfying than imagined

## Todo
The search for somewhat efficient pun generator begins. Will probably go back and work on this.
Also, this requires downloading 1.5GB Google Word2Vec model. Kind of overkill, and its really slow.
Should test alternatives.
